# Micromobility Toolset
This repository contains the software to run several trip generation and network assignment calculations for micro-mobility modes. Test data from the AMBAG bike demand model is provided.

## Model Steps

### Generate Demand
Generate OD trip tables for various market segments/purposes using network skims and landuse data.

### Incremental Demand
Given a set of base scenario trips, calculate build scenario trips from build network.

### Benefits
Calculate difference in emissions benefits between two scenarios.

### Assign Demand
Assign trips to road network links and calculate traffic volume.

## Outputs

The "initial demand" step will generate initial demand matrices using the provided
motorized utility tables and input network. This step recalculates the motorized trip utilities for
the input trip matrices to be used in the incremental demand step.

The "incremental demand" step will generate incremental demand matrices for a build scenario.

"Generate demand" can be used to build the demand tables from scratch (see **Demand** below), given network and landuse data. Each
table is indexed by origin and destination zone, and describes the costs associated with travel between zones. These tables are also used as inputs for subsequent steps.

The "benefits" step will quantify the changes in the build directory compared to
the base directory and generate the following outputs:
- **chg_emissions** - from_node, to_node, [emissions columns]
- **chg_trips** - from_node, to_node, [trips by mode columns]
- **chg_vmt** - from_node, to_node, vehicle miles traveled
- **user_ben** - from_node, to_node, minutes of user benefits

All steps will generate network level-of-service matrices (skims) for each configured mode indexed by origin and destination
zone.
- **bike_skim** - from_node, to_node, dist
- **walk_skim** - from_node, to_node, dist

The "assign demand" step will load the demand matrices into the network and write out a daily traffic volume file:
- **bike_vol** - from_node, to_node, bike_vol


## How to run the AMBAG example

The AMBAG model uses the `incremental_demand`, `benefits`, and `assign_demand` steps to compare a base scenario and a build scenario.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run incremental demand:
   ```
   python ambag_bike_model.py --name incremental_demand
   ```
3. Quantify benefits of the changes:
   ```
   python ambag_bike_model.py --name benefits
   ```
4. Assign changed demand counts to the network:
   ```
   python ambag_bike_model.py --name assign_demand
   ```

All steps may be run at once by leaving off the ``--name`` flag:
```
python ambag_bike_model.py
```

The network skims may also be generated separately from the model steps:
```
python ambag_bike_model.py --name skim_network
```
Note: skims are generated on-the-fly during the main model steps and the
``skim_network`` step does not need to be run beforehand.

## Input data
Input data may be in either CSV or SQLite format. The full test database for AMBAG (SQLite) is available
[here](https://resourcesystemsgroupinc-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ben_stabler_rsginc_com1/EftgpjU25WxKvET6Tmy39tkBRGJZmSeqlyblvzauJ2Iv0w?e=Tfl2nf).

The 25-zone example data (CSV) can be found in ``ambag_example/base/`` and ``ambag_example/build/``. Both datasets contain the
following inputs:

### auto skim
Time and distance between zones for calculating change in `benefits` step only.
- **auto_skim** - i, j, time, dist

### network
The network is defined by a link file and a node file for all scenarios. The columns found in the AMBAG example inputs are listed here:
scenarios:
- **link**:
   - link_type: TWO LANE, MULTILANE, RAMP, FREEWAY, BIKE, PATH, CENTROID C, SHUTTLE
   - length: link length
   - fhwa_fc: FHWA functional class
   - ab_ln: lanes in forward dir
   - ba_ln: lanes in reverse dir
   - area_type: zone area type measure
   - ff_speed: free-flow speed
   - bike_class: 0-4
   - ab_gain: elevation gain in forward dir
   - ba_gain: elevation gain in reverse dir
   - ab_ivt: in-vehicle time in forward dir
   - ba_ivt: in-vehicle time in reverse dir
- **node**
   - node id: node id
   - x_coord: x coordinate
   - y_coord: y coordinate
   - z_coord: z coordinate

### zones
The zones are defined by a single zone table. Additional attributes are necessary for the `generate_demand` step.
- **zone**
   - taz: taz number
   - node_id: network node id

### demand
Each table indexed by an origin and destination column, and contains initial zone-to-zone demand by mode. These tables can be generated by the 'generate_demand' step and are used as inputs for 'incremental_demand', 'benefits' and 'assign_demand'. Trip file names can be configured in `trips.yaml` according to the model's segments/purposes. The names and columns for the AMBAG example are given here:
- **hbw1trip** - home-based-work 1 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hbw2trip** - home-based-work 2 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hbw3trip** - home-based-work 3 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hbw4trip** - home-based-work 4 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hscl1trip** - home-based-school 1 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hscl2trip** - home-based-school 2 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hscl3trip** - home-based-school 3 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hscl4trip** - home-based-school 4 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk

- **hunv2trip** - home-based-univ 2 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hunv3trip** - home-based-univ 3 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **hunv4trip** - home-based-univ 4 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **nhbtrip** - non-home-based trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **nwk1trip** - non-work 1 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk
- **nwk2trip** - non-work 2 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk

- **nwk4trip** - non-work 4 trips, pzone, azone, da, s2, s3, wt, dt, wk, bk

Each demand table also has a corresponding motorized utility table to be used in the
"initial demand" step.

### configs
Additional configuration files in the ``configs`` directory
- **zone.yaml** - provides zone input configuration
- **network.yaml** - configures network inputs and attributes
- **trips.yaml** - configures demand inputs, mode, and segment coefficients
